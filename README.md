# FDF
In this project discovered the basics of graphic programming, and in particular how to place points in space, how to join them with segments and most importantly how to observe the scene from a particular viewpoint. This project is about creating a simplified graphic “wireframe” representation of a relief landscape linking various points (x, y, z) via segments.
